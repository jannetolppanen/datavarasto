The cathedral was designed by the German-born architect Ernst Bernhard Lohrmann and represents Neo-Gothic architecture. Statues of Bishop Henry, Saint Peter, and Saint Paul adorn the exterior of the church.\n\nInitially, the church served Polish soldiers in the Russian army, as well as Catholic merchants and artists in Finland. It became the cathedral of the Diocese of Helsinki in 1955. The church is one of the oldest Neo-Gothic churches in Finland.\n"

In 1981, the Lutheran parish of Kouvola donated the church to the Orthodox parish of Hamina, and it was converted back into an Orthodox church. The iconostasis of the church was painted by Margit Lintu.\n"

  "description": "The Kuivajärvi Holy Nicholas Chapel represents a western architectural style that became common in Karelian church architecture in the latter half of the 1700s, drawing inspiration from St. Petersburg. The chapel features a western tower connected to the main structure, reminiscent of separate bell towers used in medieval sanctuaries.\n\nThe current chapel, completed in 1958, is the third in the Kuivajärvi village and is modeled after the Ägläjärvi village chapel in Korpiselkä, which was destroyed in the wars. Deacon Olavi Lehmuskoski, a teacher at the Kuivajärvi school, played a significant role in its construction. Archbishop Paavali consecrated the chapel in June 1958. The building was commissioned by the Finnish Orthodox Church under a reconstruction law, as the previous chapel was destroyed during military operations. The chapel exemplifies the carpentry skills of the village men. The icons inside were painted by the artist Martha Neiglick-Platonov.\n"

The icons in the iconostasis were painted by Berndt Abraham Godenhjelm, while other icons originated from Valamo Monastery.\n"

It was built there out of gratitude by islanders who were rescued from a storm on Lake Ladoga in the mid-19th century. Nikolai Jokiniemi built the chapel, and Maila Mäkinen painted the icons on its end wall, depicting Christ Pantocrator, the Valamo Mother of God, and St. Nicholas saving those in distress.

The church's bell tower, also built by Åkergren, was completed in 1800. Originally, the exterior walls were bare logs, painted red in 1802. Later, in 1832, the church was clad with boarding, also painted red.\n\nTowards the end of the century, the interior walls and ceiling were painted and paneled, and the exterior walls were painted white. In 1892, the church acquired an 11-stop organ from the Kangasala organ factory, and in 1898, it got its first heating system. Significant restoration work was carried out in 1939. In 2023, the church went through a renovation project to update its technology and make functional changes.\n"

It is also a popular concert church because of its good acoustics. The factory handed over the church to the Tampere Evangelical Lutheran parishes in 1981. One condition of the handover was that the church would continue to be called the Finlayson Church. Today, it also serves as a children's cathedral.\n"

From there, the cantor led the congregation's singing before the organ. The ceiling paintings on the inside are by Hannes Malin from Heinola. They were made in the 18th century style. The current altarpiece, which depicts Jesus carrying his cross, was donated to the congregation in 1860.\n"

The red-brick church building is currently undergoing renovations, expected to be completed by the end of 2025. The renovations include re-bricking the exterior due to microbe damage, with custom-made bricks to match the original curved facades. The interior is also being updated, but with care to preserve its cultural and historical significance. Inside, the main entrances to the church hall are located on either side of the altar, and the ceiling features a metal grid that distributes light, primarily from skylights. Smaller rooms, such as those used for confirmation classes and youth work, surround the hall on two floors and can be connected to the main hall if needed.\n"

  "description": "The Church of the Good Shepherd is located in Pakila, Helsinki, near the intersection of the Kehä I ring road and Tuusulanväylä highway. Originally built in 1950 and known as Pakila Church, it underwent extensive renovation and expansion in 2002. Architect Juha Leiviskä designed the renovation, seamlessly blending the old and new architecture. The name, Church of the Good Shepherd, comes from a relief in the old church hall, now a parish hall. A key element of the new church hall is light, evident in the lighting and vertical windows. The church also has a children's chapel and features art by Markku Pääkkönen, Taisto Martiskainen, Agneta Hobin, and Juri Saarikoski. Its seven bells play melodies that vary with the church year.\n"

It's believed to have been built sometime in the early 16th century, possibly between 1513 and 1533. One of the most remarkable features of the Old Church is its interior, which is decorated with 114 large-sized murals dating back to the 1560s. These paintings depict biblical stories and were hidden under layers of whitewash for over 200 years before being rediscovered in 1885.\n\nThe New Church, completed in 1877, represents a different architectural style. Designed by Georg Th. Chiewitz, this neo-Gothic church is constructed of red brick and features a tower. The altarpiece is a copy of Rubens' \"Christ on the Cross\", painted by Ida Silverberg in 1878.\n"

It was built to replace the previous church that was destroyed in a fire in 1980.\n\nThe glass facade at the entrance of the church reflects the old bell tower, which survived the fire. The bell tower was erected at its current location in 1815. The church is part of the Kuopio parish. As of 2020, there were concerns about the church's structural integrity and potential need for costly repairs or even demolition. There have been discussions about either renovating the existing church or building a new, smaller one.\n"

From above, the church resembles a fish, an early Christian symbol. The church also includes a chapel for small gatherings.\n\nThe church's modern appearance stirred much debate upon its completion and continues to do so.

However, he agreed to design the Killinkoski church out of wood because he was related to the founder of the local ribbon factory. It was also the last church Stenbäck designed. The church combines elements of Jugend, National Romanticism, and Neo-Gothic styles. The church has 150 seats and a 6-stop organ built in 1963.\n"

  "description": "Kärsämäki church was originally designed by Carl Ludvig Engel in 1828, but it wasn't constructed until 1842. However, there is also a modern shingle church named Paanukirkko located near the site of the original church by the Pyhäjoki river. Paanukirkko was completed in 2004 and designed by architect Anssi Lassila. It's a modern church constructed using 18th-century methods.\n\nThe building consists of a timber \"heart\" surrounded by a black tarred shingle \"coat\". It was built between 2000 and 2004 with both voluntary and paid labor, with funding from the European Union. The total construction cost was 1,181,040 euros. The church has an area of approximately 100 square meters and is one of the most significant sights in the municipality, attracting thousands of tourists annually.\n"

The sacristy was built in 1876, but otherwise, the exterior of the church looks the same as it did 200 years ago.\n\nInside, the biggest change occurred in 1912 when an organ loft was built. The current organ was installed in 1992, when the old organ was moved to the Kökar Museum. The church has several objects from Kökar's old wooden church from the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries, including a large crucifix, an alms box, an old altarpiece, and a wooden pelican that hangs above the pulpit. The current altarpiece, dating from 1803, depicts the Eucharist. A votive ship from the old wooden church, an ornate wooden pirate ship with 64 cannons, also resides here. According to tradition, the ship is a scale model of a Turkish pirate ship built by a Kökar sailor, Johans Olle. In the front of the church is also a baptismal font from the early 13th century. It is said to have been found in the wall of the monastery church.\n"

However, construction halted in August 1914 when garrison units moved to the front lines of World War I.\n\nAfter Finland's independence, the unfinished church became state property.

The altar painting, \"Christ on the Cross,\" is by Ilmari Launis from 1924. The church represents typical Neo-Byzantine style and hosts services and concerts.\n"

  "description": "Liedenpohja Church is a wooden church building in the village of Liedenpohja, Virrat. It's situated on the Isoharju ridge, approximately 20 kilometers from the center of Virrat towards Alavus.\n\nThe church was originally a school building constructed about 60 years prior to 1955. In 1955, the municipality of Virrat relinquished the building, and the local parish association decided to purchase and move it next to the cemetery on land they had acquired. Local volunteers also moved the granite foundation.\n\nThe building was converted into a church according to plans by Voipa Sulkava. The church, which has a hundred seats, was consecrated by Bishop Eero Lehtinen of Lapua on October 8, 1961. The church bell was donated in 1966. The church was electrified in 1970, switching from stoves to electric heating. The cemetery surrounding the church was established in 1950.\n"

During the renovation, the altar was moved to a more central location, and the traditional pews were replaced with chairs to allow for different seating arrangements. In the fall of 2022, a small new section, called the \"Leipähuone\" (Bread Room), was completed, featuring a small kitchen and accessible restroom. New organ with 27 stops was inaugurated in 2024.

Elenius. The contract price was 22,790 marks, with the agreement that the parishioners would provide all the building materials. The old church was dismantled, and usable materials were incorporated into the new structure. During construction, services were held at Söderby school. The church was ready for inspection by October 31, 1886, and it was consecrated during a bishop's inspection on the first Advent Sunday of the same year. The church is open to visitors during the summer months.\n"

The old cemetery has the Törne family monument and Sakari Pälsi's grave.\n\nRegular church services were held there until 1805. Nowadays, an evening devotion is held in the church once a week. The location on top of a steep hill, the lack of electricity, and the absence of an organ somewhat limit the church's use.\n"

  "description": "Luhanka Church, also known as Luhanka Summer Church or Luhanka Old Church, is one of the largest wooden churches in Finland. Designed by architect Josef Stenbäck and completed in 1893, it represents the Neo-Gothic style. The church is located slightly off the scenic route between Luhanka and Sysmä.\n\nWith approximately 1,500 seats, the church is a popular venue for concerts. Because it lacks heating and electric lights, it is only used during the summer months. The church features an altarpiece painted by S. Danielsson in 1906, titled \"Jesus Stands at the Door and Knocks\". Samuli Edelmann's hymns albums were recorded in this church. There is a parking lot for cars in the churchyard.\n"

The first mention of the Nousiainen Church in contemporary sources dates back to 1232. The remains of Bishop Henry were moved from Nousiainen Church to Turku Cathedral in the 1290s.\n\nOriginally designed with two naves, the plans were altered during construction, resulting in a three-nave church with cross vaults. Simple square brick pillars support these vaults, adorned with paintings, likely from the 1430s, rediscovered in 1936 under layers of limewash. The church has undergone renovations and restorations in 1377, 1770, 1786, 1847, 1901, 1936, and 1967-69.\n"

The church represents Engel's neoclassical style, featuring straight lines, light surfaces, marbling, and gilding, creating a festive and dignified atmosphere.\n\nOriginally named Sofia Magdalena's Church after the wife of King Gustav III, it was designed by Daniel Hagman. The cathedral can accommodate approximately a thousand people and remains a recognizable landmark and a popular tourist destination.\n"

It was originally built in 1905 as a prayer room for the Evangelical Association. The construction of the wooden church was partly done through volunteer work by the people of Oulunkylä.\n\nIn 1919, when the Oulunkylä parish was founded, the prayer room was converted into a temporary church. The parish later purchased it in 1950 and it served as the main church until 1972, when a new church was built. Since then, this charming wooden church has been a popular venue for baptisms and weddings. The altar features a bronze relief depicting Jesus blessing children, created by the Swedish sculptor Harald Sörensen-Ringi in 1909.\n"

The church is made of timber, featuring exposed logs on both the exterior and interior. An integral bell tower sits above the entrance at the western end.\n\nInitially, the church was built without formal permission, leading to complaints. However, it was eventually consecrated in 1787.

The church has been damaged or destroyed by fire several times throughout its history, including incidents in the 16th, 18th, and 21st centuries.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the cathedral has been rebuilt and restored, and it remains an important landmark and a popular venue for worship, concerts, and weddings. In 1809, Porvoo Diet was held in the cathedral, during which Emperor Alexander I confirmed Finland's autonomy. Today, it serves as the main church for the Porvoo Finnish Parish and the Diocese of Borgå.\n"

  "description": "The Raippaluoto Church, also known as the Kustaa Aadolf Church, dates back to 1781. It's a wooden long church with a steep roof and no tower. The altar structure and pulpit were moved from St. Mary's Church in Old Vaasa in the 1840s, which saved them from the fire in 1852. The church holds services of the Finnish Parish of Mustasaari, especially during Christmas and Easter, and also ecclesiastical services such as weddings. The church was designed by Johan Elfström in 1778. Inside, visitors are often surprised by the walls, which lean noticeably southward. The separate bell tower is in the Ostrobothnian Renaissance style and was built in 1783.\n"

  "description": "Sipoo Church, also known as the New Church, is a red-brick building designed by Theodor Decker in the Neo-Gothic style. Consecrated in 1885, it was built because the Old Church of Sipoo became too small for the growing congregation in the 19th century. The Finnish and Swedish congregations of Sipoo both use the church.\n\nOriginally, the altar wall was open, but it was later walled up to conceal a new heating system. In 2001, geothermal heating was installed, which allowed the altar wall to be restored to its original appearance. The church hall was also repainted to match its original colors. The first organ was acquired in 1890. The current organ, a Danish Marcussen &amp; Søn mechanical organ from 1951, was the first Neo-Baroque organ in Finland.\n"

A pillory and a \"shame bench\" from the 17th and 18th centuries can also be found within the church. The church's bell tower, originally made of wood, was rebuilt in stone in 1811.\n"

  "description": "The Sulva Church, located in Mustasaari, Finland, is a wooden long church representing Gustavian neoclassical style, built between 1783 and 1786. Johan Elfström designed the church, which lacks a tower. The building features two narrow annexes of the same height as the main body, positioned on the central axis. The roof of the main building is hipped at the ends, with a small roof lantern. Horizontal-boarded pilasters articulate the exterior walls, and the windows are round-arched. Inside, a wooden barrel vault serves as the ceiling. The church has undergone several renovations throughout the years.\n\nA separate wooden belfry, designed by Carl Axel Setterberg, was constructed in 1870 and houses bells dating back to 1726 and 1858. The church has a floor area of 343 square meters and can accommodate 700 people. The church boasts a four-part altar piece considered one of the most significant works of folk baroque wood carving in Finland.\n"

The church tower and armory were likely built at the end of the 14th century, while the sacristy dates back to the mid-15th century.\n\nInside, the church has been well-preserved. Wall paintings of Saint Margaret, Catherine of Alexandria, and an anonymous male saint date from the early 14th century. The altarpiece, featuring Mary and the baby Jesus in the center, was made in the 1430s or 1440s. The church gives a somewhat fortress-like impression due to its sturdy construction. The stone part of the church tower is 22 meters high, and its floor area is the second largest in Finland after Turku Cathedral.\n"

During the fire, the wooden upper part of the belfry built in 1766 was destroyed. However, the altarpiece painted by R.W. Ekman in 1848, communion dishes, and old church textiles were saved.\n\nAfter the fire, the church was rebuilt according to architect Kauno S. Kallio's plans, and the side naves were removed to restore the church to its original medieval size. The ceiling and wall paintings in the rebuilt church were created by artist Kalle Carlstedt. The church was last restored between 1998 and 1999.\n"

After twelve years, Baron Wrede, one of the owners of the Taalintehdas ironworks, purchased the church and offered it for rent to the Evangelical-Lutheran congregation. The church was consecrated as Evangelical-Lutheran in 1934, and the congregation bought the church in 1978.\n\nThe church is constructed from slag bricks, which were made from the waste of the Taalintehdas iron furnace. Karl Andström designed the church. The church's bell tower was inaugurated at the church's 25th-anniversary celebration. The church has good acoustics and is used as a concert venue. The organ has nine voices and was built in 1967 by Hans Heinrich. The altar painting is by Axel Haartman.\n"

  "description": "Temmes Church is a wooden church located in the village of Temmes, in the municipality of Tyrnävä. It belongs to the Tyrnävä parish. The church was originally built between 1766 and 1767 as a prayer room, based on the decision and at the expense of the villagers of Temmes and Kärsämä, without approved drawings. According to tradition, it was designed and built by Antti Louet.\n\nThe church is one of the last support pillar churches built in Finland. These types of churches were common in the Ostrobothnia region in the 17th century. The church has a western tower that is partially embedded in the main building. Inside, the walls are made of exposed logs painted yellow. The barrel vault ceiling is painted blue. The three-part altarpiece was painted by Carl Christoffer Stadig in 1847. Next to the church gate stands Finland's largest \"vaivaisukko\", a wooden alms box statue.\n"

The Tervakoski Little Church Association, founded the previous year, initiated the project. The Tervakoski paper mill supported the construction by donating logs from the Toiva Manor's old drying barn. Architect Jarl Eklund designed the church, and local villagers built it through communal work.\n\nHilbert from Helsinki, a professional decorator, completed the interior decorative paintings. In 1939, the paper mill constructed a bell tower and donated it to the association. Gösta Serlachius, a patron of the arts, donated an altarpiece painted by Georges von Swetlick in 1937. The church received a 450 kg church bell from Oskari Vaara, the director of the Napiala Leather Factory. The church came under the ownership of the Janakkala Parish in 1973.\n"

  "description": "Tuira Church is located in the Tuira district of Oulu. It was originally built as a prayer room and consecrated for that purpose on August 25, 1916. The building was designed by Harald Andersin, a county architect of Oulu, and represents National Romanticism architectural style.\n\nIn 1966, Oulu implemented a division of parishes, and Tuira was separated into its own parish, at which point the prayer room was consecrated as a church. At the same time, expansion work on the church began, and was designed by architect Mikko Huhtela and completed in 1967. From 1988 to 1992, the church was renovated and the church hall was restored. The renovation work was designed by architects Ulla and Lasse Vahtera. The church hall can accommodate 240 people. The stained glass paintings in Tuira Church, \"The Birth of Christ\" and \"The Ascension of Christ\", are by the artist Paavo Leinonen. The simple, unadorned crucifix is made by sculptor and painter Martti Tarvainen.\n"

In the winter of 1922, the church was moved back to its original location in Turkansaari. Since information about the original interior had not been preserved, Turkansaari Church had to be rebuilt using other similar small churches from the late 17th century as models. The exterior door and hymn board leg came from the dismantled Enontekiö Markkina Church. The pulpit model was borrowed from the old Sodankylä Church.\n\nThe church is a popular wedding venue and hosts services in the summer. It can accommodate about 120 people.\n"

The altar wall features a partial sketch of \"Eternal Life,\" a mural left unfinished due to the artist's death. A wooden crucifix, specially made for Töölö Church in Oberammergau, known for its Easter plays, adorns the altar.\n\nArchitect Hilding Ekelund designed the church. The building was originally planned to be a parish building and was officially dedicated as a church when Töölö became its own parish in 1941. Above the entrance, you'll find a concrete relief, \"Heavenly Feast\" by Gunnar Finne. The foyer showcases Gunnar Forsström's glass paintings and a mural by Paavo Leinonen.\n"

In 1643, a low intermediate ceiling was added, and two church bells were acquired. In 1713, during the Great Northern War, Russian forces used one end of the church as a granary while the other end remained in use for worship.

However, the independence project failed, and the prayer house remained as it was. A bell tower was built next to the church in 1967.\nThe cemetery was inaugurated in the autumn of 1958.

  "description": "Velkua Church, also known as St. Henry's Church, is a wooden long church dating back to 1793. It is located on the island of Palva, in the former municipality of Velkua, now part of Naantali. The church is dedicated to St. Henry and is the only church in Velkua's history.\n\nThe church received new bells in 1813, as the previous ones had been hidden or looted by the Russians. One of the bells later broke and was replaced in 1880. At the turn of the 20th century, a major renovation was carried out, which included building an organ loft and paneling the log walls. The Finnish Heritage Agency demanded the removal of the organ loft, which was done in 1964. In 1982, the church was electrified, and the wood-burning stove could be removed.\n\nThe Velkua church landscape, which includes Velkua Church and Velkua village, has been defined as a nationally significant built cultural environment.\n"

The villagers also donated items to the church, such as communion cups, chandeliers, and candlesticks. The cross-shaped church has approximately 250 seats. Originally the church was red. The graveyard surrounding the church was established in 1827 on land donated by Tuomola. The altar painting was painted by Jonas Bergman and was previously located in the old Loimaa church.

Stained glass paintings, titled \"Lupaus\" (Promise) and \"Kaipaus\" (Longing), adorn the altar windows. These were created by Veijo Muroke and portray biblical themes set in the Yli-Ii landscape. The church has a 12-stop organ that was built in 1984. A war memorial is located near the church.\n"

Wahlroos, and Kustaa Räihä was the master builder. There are 550 seats in the church. The church was consecrated on July 14, 1940. The bell tower dates back to the old church, built in 1819, and is probably the oldest building in Ylitornio. The altarpiece was painted by J. Hedman in 1818. In the churchyard is a memorial to the heroes sculpted by Kalervo Kallio, called \"Praying Mother\".\n"
