The museum area was formed in the 1950s-1970s when buildings were moved there from the then-Jämsänkoski area.\n\nThe buildings of Aarresaari offer a journey back in time to the local history from the 16th century to the early 20th century. The buildings and objects display traditional agriculture and the early stages of industrialization. The museum has buildings such as storehouses, a watermill, a frame saw, a smoke sauna, and workers' cottages. The oldest buildings are the wilderness storehouses and watermills. The interiors and furniture in the old workers' cottages aim to reflect the authentic living conditions of the 1800s and early 1900s.\n",

  "description": "Annalan kotiseutumuseo is one of the largest local history museum areas in Northern Finland. The museum area features 22 buildings and nearly 8,000 artifacts.\n\nThe museum displays rural life before the age of tractors. You can find a village shop from times of scarcity (\"pula-aika\"), a jail (\"putka\"), a soldier's croft, and even a windmill. The museum exhibits a wide range of items, from bank manager's hats to lumberjack's tools.\n\nThe Annala farm's origins date back to the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 1930s, the large farm became municipal property, housing the municipal office, wartime public welfare services, and a municipal secondary school. The museum was established in 1963 from items originating from the museum section of a local exhibition held in 1957.\n",

Artifacts were collected from all over the village with the help of village agents.\n\nThe museum's renovated main exhibition opened in 2021. It showcases key aspects of Hausjärvi's history through objects, photographs, and texts. The oldest items date back to the Stone Age, with the majority from the 18th and 19th centuries.

Designed as both an artist's studio and a family home, Kalela embodies Gallen-Kallela's architectural aspirations and was built according to his detailed drawings in 1894 and 1895.

The main castle measures about 30x20 meters, while the bailey is about 45x25 meters. Originally, the castle was built on a small island with rows of poles surrounding it to prevent landings. The most prominent part of the castle is the high Kuri Tower, located in the center of the castle.\n\nThroughout its history, Kastelholm Castle has served as an administrative center and has been the site of sieges, attacks, and witch trials. In the 17th century, the castle lost its significance as an administrative center, and in 1745, a large part of it burned down. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction.\n",

  "description": "Masku Museum, founded in 1974, is located in the village of Humikkala, about 300 meters southeast of Masku Church. The museum's collection mainly consists of peasant artifacts, totaling around 1600 items. In addition, the museum has a collection of over 450 books and magazines.\n\nThe museum building dates back to the 1840s and has changed over the years. Originally, it was a double-roomed house with a saddle roof. Later, the house received an additional wing and a neoclassical appearance with a hipped roof. The museum grounds include two outbuildings dating back to the mid-1800s. These outbuildings were renovated in the early 1990s and serve as exhibition and storage space for the museum.\n\nIn the past, the building served as an inn. The museum is open during the summer, and admission is free.\n",

Thanks to the local village association, the old power plant was preserved and transformed into a museum in 1991, offering visitors a glimpse into the past. You can even take a virtual tour of the museum online.\n",

She holds a bowl to catch the venom, offering him what comfort she can. When the bowl is full, she has to leave to empty it, and during those moments the poison falls on Loki, causing him great pain and the earth to tremble.
