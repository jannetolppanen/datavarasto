  "description": "The Antonius Abtkerk in Bergen op Zoom is a former Roman Catholic church. The third church with this name was built in 1951, designed by J. de Lint. It is a three-aisled basilica with a narthex, flanked by a baptismal and devotion chapel, and an apse at the rear, flanked by two square towers with tent roofs.\n\nThe design shows influence from early Christian and early Romanesque church architecture in Italy. In 2000, the church was deconsecrated. It was saved from demolition due to protests from local residents. Since August 2002, it has housed the Franke daycare center and, since October 2003, also the Het Hoofdkwartier neighborhood center.\n",

  "description": "The Bartholomeüskerk in Noordlaren is a church originally dedicated to Saint Bartholomew. Its oldest parts date back to the 12th century when a wooden church was first erected. During the 13th century, the current stone building was constructed in several phases. The church largely acquired its present appearance in the 15th century.\n\nThe church is known for its unique paintings and a 16th-century alms box. In 1876, Petrus van Oeckelen and his sons built the current organ. The church is used by the Protestant congregation of Noordlaren-Glimmen and is owned by the Stichting Oude Groninger Kerken since 2021. It serves as a wedding location for the municipality of Groningen and is used for funeral and wedding services. Concerts are occasionally held there.\n",

  "description": "The Basiliek van Onze Lieve Vrouwe Tenhemelopneming in Zwolle is a medieval cross church. The building was constructed in four phases. The first phase took place between 1394 and 1417. The second phase occurred between 1452 and 1454 when the nave was completed with a west facade. The third phase included the construction of a tower between 1463 and 1483, finalized with the installation of six bells.\n\nIn 1999, the church received the honorary title of basilica on its 600th anniversary. During the Reformation, it fell into disuse but was later returned to the Roman Catholics during the French era. The basilica is still used for Catholic services and musical performances, often featuring choirs accompanied by the Maarschalkerweerd organ. The church's tower, called \"Peperbus\", is a landmark of Zwolle.\n",

It's a striking example of Neo-Gothic architecture in Limburg, built between 1875-1879. The basilica has a cruciform shape and includes side aisles with galleries, an ambulatory with radiating chapels, and a high crossing tower. The tower is adorned with openwork, polygonal turrets at its corners.\n\nInside, the church features a richly decorated interior. The high vaults and galleries reduce the amount of light, creating a rather dark atmosphere. Stained glass windows depict various biblical figures and scenes. The basilica also houses an organ built in 1954. The church's spiritual significance is emphasized by a statue of Our Lady above the altar, symbolizing the distribution of God's grace.\n",

In 1966, the Bethelkerk was renovated and reopened on February 23, 1967. After the Reformed Church moved to the Sion Church in 1979, the Bethelkerk was sold to the Free Evangelical Church of Goes.\n\nThe Bethelkerk houses an organ with electro-pneumatic action. In 1966, the organ was modified by organ builder M.K. Koppejan from Ederveen. The number of registers has been expanded to 20, divided over two manuals and a free pedal. The organ was then moved and the console was placed separately.\n",

Although it was initially considered to establish two parishes for Overvecht-Noord, in the end there was only one. The parish was founded in 1970 and dedicated to the Annunciation. That same year, construction began and was completed in 1971. After the Heilige Geestkerk and the Emmaüskerk, this was the third Catholic church for Overvecht.\n\nIn 2005, the church was taken into use again by Chinese Christians, who kept the name of the church.

Built between 1964 and 1966, it was designed by the architectural firm A.F. Brenninkmeyer. The church features a hexagonal floor plan based on a grid of equilateral triangles.\n\nIn 2011, after a series of burglaries and acts of vandalism, the parish church was closed. Since 2012, the Armenian Apostolic Church of Maastricht has been using the building, and in January 2013, it was consecrated and opened as the Surp Karapetkerk, which means Holy Forerunner, referring to John the Baptist. A slender belfry on three concrete legs marks the location of the church.\n",

  "description": "The Corneliuskerk in Noordwelle is a late Gothic Evangelical Reformed church located in the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands. The church has a four-bay nave and a three-bay chancel with a 5/8 closure. Dedicated to Saint Cornelius before the Reformation, its construction dates back to the second half of the 15th century.\n\nDuring the Eighty Years' War in 1575, Spanish troops sought refuge in the church. The church was set on fire, resulting in the death of all the soldiers. It was later restored. In 1754, a striking octagonal structure was added to the square lower levels of the tower. In 1892, the chancel was repurposed into a school, but this was reversed during a renovation in 1960. Today, the church is used for church services, weddings and funerals but also for concerts and lectures. It has a Bechstein grand piano and a church organ built by Flaes and Brunjes.\n",

The interior originally had sparse decorations, in line with Lutheran principles. However, much of even those decorations, including cornices, were later removed. The building served different secular functions for over a hundred years. It was renovated in the late 90s by architect Francine Houben, who combined the authentic pillars and windows with industrial elements, creating a mix of classic and modern materials. The main hall retains its history with a ceiling that rises in round shapes and wooden columns.\n",

  "description": "The Krijtberg Church, a Roman Catholic church located on the Singel in Amsterdam, was designed by Alfred Tepe and opened in 1883. Dedicated to St. Francis Xavier, it is known for its neo-Gothic style, featuring two pointed towers. Space limitations led to an unusually tall design with a monumental front. The interior, crafted by Friedrich Wilhelm Mengelberg, is exuberantly decorated.\n\nSince 1654, there has been a Jesuit church at this location. The current church was built on the same site as previous clandestine churches. The Krijtberg's construction was never entirely finished, with new elements added over time, such as the confessionals dating from 1889 and stained glass windows installed in 1946.",

Built in 1961 and designed by architect Van Kranendonk, it was a modern church with a square floor plan and a unique design resembling a \"stolpboerderij\" (a traditional West Frisian farmhouse) without a tower.\n\nThe building featured a colonnade of concrete supporting a high wooden tent roof. Light entered the space from above through an opening in the roof, where a bell was also placed. Stained glass windows, crafted by Joep Nicolas, adorned the spaces between the pillars of the colonnade. Despite opposition from citizens, the church was demolished in August 2007. Some of the stained glass windows were relocated to the Sint Jozefkerk in Alkmaar, and the organ was moved to a church in Roermond.\n",

  "description": "The Don Boscokerk was a Roman Catholic parish church located on Mimosaplein in the Stratum district of Eindhoven. Built in 1953, it was designed by architect Kees de Bever and inspired by early Christian church architecture from the 6th century.\n\nThe church is a three-aisled brick structure. Unusually, the altar was located in the center, creating a T-shape with only a nave and transept. The central area is topped by a robust square structure with four attics holding bells, crowned by a pediment. A low, round tower sits in the middle. Other notable features include a nearly detached cylindrical tower to the left of the facade and a round baptistery.\n\nDue to declining church attendance, the nave was used for services in the early 1970s, with community facilities in the transept. The final service was held on March 19, 2006, after which the church was sold. In 2020, the church was transformed into a residential complex with 17 apartments, while preserving the original aesthetic elements.\n",

Some structural elements of the brewery, particularly the side and back walls, were integrated into the church. The facade, however, was entirely new and designed in Louis XVI style.

The building was designed with a multi-functional character, with the attic used for ammunition and hay storage. The consistory, located behind the church, used to house two horse stables, with a staircase leading to the hayloft.\n\nIn the 19th century, these functions were discontinued, and the attic was removed, giving the church space a vault. Inside, the pulpit from the early 19th century stands out. The text boards originally hung in the Der Aa-kerk in Groningen. The church also has a special bench for soldiers who were arrested. The single-manual church organ was made in 1874 by Hermanus Knipscheer and was moved to Nieuweschans in 1925.

The 14th-century building obtained a new chancel with ambulatory, a transept, and a tower that exceeded the height of the St. Eusebius Church in Arnhem, making it the tallest in Gelderland. A large portion of the church was lost when the tower collapsed in 1797, destroying part of the nave. Subsequently, the remaining part of the nave was closed off with a new facade in a sober Louis XVI style, under the guidance of Teunis Wittenberg.\n",

In 1245, the church became the property of the Bethlehem monastery and was dedicated to Saint Laurentius, hence the name Laurentiuskerk.\n\nThe church was largely destroyed by fire in 1723, except for the tower. However, the tower was damaged by lightning in 1793. Both the nave and the tower were rebuilt. The reformation in the Varsseveld area took place between 1580 and 1590. The name of the church was then changed to Grote Kerk, but the name Laurentius has always remained in popular usage, hence the name \"Grote of Laurentiuskerk\". The church is now suitable for concerts, performances, lectures, exhibitions and church services. A special aspect of the church are the stained glass windows, which were installed during the restoration from 1971 to 1978.\n",

It once had the tallest tower in the Netherlands, which collapsed in 1682 after several lightning strikes. Today, an octagonal consistory stands where the tower once was.\n\nInside, highlights include the 16th-century choir screen, the pulpit, the Schnitger organ, and the pews. Fragments of 15th-century frescoes, a fragment of the former Sacrament tower, and a tympanum with the old city coat of arms can also be found. The church now serves a new function in Zwolle, hosting exhibitions, concerts, theater, films, and expositions. It is a place where spirituality and culture come together.\n",

  "description": "The Heilige Familiekerk was a Roman Catholic church in Maastricht, located on Old Hickoryplein in the Wyckerpoort neighborhood. It was built between 1959 and 1961, designed by Theo Boosten. The church was an example of a building that consciously sought new forms, designed to provide a fitting closure to the south side of the large rectangular square.\n\nIt was a hall church on a rectangular plan, consisting of various, mostly symmetrical parts, which were placed asymmetrically. The brick building was spanned with a steel structure. A striking feature was the three, actually five-sided entrance portal. The church was closed in 1997 due to a decline in churchgoers and demolished in 1999.\n",

  "description": "The Heilige Familiekerk, located in 't Kruis in the Dutch municipality of Heerhugowaard, is a Roman Catholic church. Together with the adjacent parsonage, it forms a municipal monument. This striking white church was built between 1922 and 1923 by a local contractor, Bot. The original Neo-Gothic design was by J.F. Klomp from The Hague, but the church later underwent significant renovations, giving the pointed arch windows an almost Art Deco-like appearance. Only the choir at the rear still exhibits Neo-Gothic elements. The church features a modern entrance portal and an open bell cage above it, housing two bells named Aagje and Adriaan after the parishioners who donated them. The church interior was thoroughly restored in 1988, and various other changes have been made to the whitewashed church since then.\n",

  "description": "The Waag in Alkmaar was originally built in the 14th century as a chapel for the adjacent Holy Spirit Hospital. This hospital provided free accommodation for poor travelers for three days and nights, and also cared for the sick. In 1566, the Bishop of Haarlem permitted the hospital to repurpose the building for weighing purposes. By 1582, the weighing activities were moved to the larger Holy Spirit Chapel, which was no longer used for religious services. The conversion of the chapel into a weighing house was completed in 1583. Today, the Waag houses the Dutch Cheese Museum and a tourist information office. The tower has a carillon played weekly and an automatic display with horses, knights and a trumpet player.\n",

The chapel's blue slate floor largely originated from the former Dutch Reformed church of Lutjebroek. Sadly, fresco traces on the walls in Den Oever were lost during reconstruction. The pulpit bears the inscription \"Those who believe in Christ through God's spirit have a place prepared here and above.\" The cabinet organ, made in 1853 by Hermanus Knipscheer, came from the Enkhuizen cemetery.\n",

The tower has two sections with a tent roof and houses a clock from 1659. Above the entrance is a reused mannerist facade stone from around 1630. In 1975, the church and the attached consistory room were enlarged. The interior is covered by a dome and the arched windows have stained glass. The pulpit from the 17th century comes from the old church. The organ from 1909 was made by Bakker & Timmenga. The church is a national monument. In 2012, the church was sold and taken over by the Reformed Church, which had previously met in Olterterp.\n",

Its style is mainly Late Romanesque, recognizable by the layout and treatment of the walls, featuring a lower and upper level with decorative masonry in the upper section. However, its high walls and pointed arch windows give it a Gothic appearance.\n\nInside, the church boasts dome vaults, murals, and vault paintings, along with remnants from its Catholic past, like an aumbry in the choir and a piscina. The interior is richly adorned with a choir screen, an elaborately carved pulpit, and a Schnitger organ. The local committee organizes exhibitions, lectures, organ recitals and guided tours and church services are also regularly held.\n",

Alterations were made to the interior in the 19th century, including a higher roof. The original columns were replaced with wooden ones, and the tower was raised. Restorations took place in 1949-1950 and again from 2005-2011. Since then, it has been used not only for church services but also for social-cultural activities.\n",

Although the April specifications were slightly modified, the construction was contracted out to the Middelburg contractor C.J. van Uije on November 19 for 23,000 guilders. The 3,000 guilder deficit was covered by selling remnants of the old church for 1,000 guilders, and requesting a 2,000 guilder subsidy from the Provincial College. The College forwarded the request to the minister, who obtained another 1,000 guilders from King Willem I.

The large window at the rear is also a design by the same architect, representing the symbolic form of the earth encircled by a snake, bearing the tablets of the law, above which the cross rises. A bird symbolizes the resurrection, while a bundle of rays represents the light of divine truth. The church was built by the Groothengel company from Borne and is now used for multiple purposes. Besides Sunday services, performances are regularly held there due to its excellent acoustics.\n",

In 1936, it became the location of the Haarlem Archives, and following restorations between 1975 and 1980, it now houses the North Holland Archives. Many items from the church that weren't removed have survived and are in the Frans Hals Museum or the Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht.\n",

  "description": "The Janskerk is a Romanesque basilica located on the Janskerkhof in the center of Utrecht. It is dedicated to John the Baptist and once served as a church for the chapter of St. John. Founded shortly after 1040 by Bishop Bernold, it was one of the city's five collegiate churches that formed the Utrecht church cross during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn 1580, Catholic worship was prohibited, and the Janskerk lost its function as a collegiate church. It was later used as a city library and then a university library. The Reformed Church acquired the church in 1656. After years of disrepair, the church was thoroughly renovated in the 20th century. Today, the Janskerk hosts classical and choral concerts and holds services by the Ecumenical Student Community of Utrecht.\n",

  "description": "The Jeruzalemkerk is a Protestant church located in the Amsterdam West district, in the neighborhood of De Baarsjes, near Mercatorplein. It was built between 1928 and 1929, designed by architect Ferdinand Jantzen. The original idea was to name it the Nieuwe Westerkerk, however the name Jeruzalemkerk was eventually chosen. This name came from the fundraising campaign \"City without a Temple\" used to finance the construction.\n\nThe church's architecture is a good example of the Amsterdam School style. It is built connected to the adjoining housing block. The exterior and interior contain many symbols. The stained-glass windows were also designed by Jantzen. The church is oriented north-south, unlike most churches which are oriented east-west.",

  "description": "The Jesuit monastery on Bredestraat, also known as the First or Old Jesuit Monastery, was the first establishment of the Society of Jesus in Maastricht. The cornerstone was laid in 1606, and in 1614 the church was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. Originally, the barrel vault was painted with depictions of saints, but around 1750 it was replaced by a baroque stucco ceiling. The sacristy was located on the east side of the church on Bredestraat, supposedly the birthplace of Saint Lambert. Between the sacristy and the old chapel was a small courtyard surrounded by columns, called the atrium. After the Jesuit order was abolished in 1773, the Jesuits resettled in Maastricht in 1853. Of the first monastery remains the heavily altered monastery church (the current Bonbonnière) and a monastery wing.",

The altar is relatively shallow.\n\nThe sober expressionist design in clean brickwork makes extensive use of the geometric figure of the parabola. Stained glass in the church was made by the Lou Asperslagh studio in The Hague. Until 2014, it was used by the Roman Catholic parish of the same name.\n\nIn 2016, the Vianneykerk became the property of Peter Vredeveld, a dealer in Buddha statues and Asian art. The zoning plan has been amended to allow an art gallery in the church. With respect for the monumental value of the building, a gallery for Asian art was established there.\n",

It's a fairly tall, brick hall church with a gently sloping gable roof, accessible by an imposing staircase. Built in 1963 in a functionalist style, it was designed by S. van Woerden and H.J. Schneider for the Association of Liberal Protestants.\n\nCurrently, the Johanneskerk is used by a collaboration of Liberal Protestants, Mennonites, and Remonstrants. Cultural events, such as concerts, also take place in the building. The church houses an organ built in 1965 by the Van Vulpen company. For a short time, it was also rented to the Orthodox Parish of Amersfoort.\n",

  "description": "The Johanneskerk, also known as the Johannescentrum, is a Protestant church building in the Overvecht district of Utrecht. The church is dedicated to the evangelist John. It was built in the 1960s, along with the construction of the Overvecht district. The architect, L.J. Linssen, designed the building according to Protestant guidelines established in 1954, which emphasized unity in the church space, avoiding features like communion rails or colonnades. The windows were designed to provide soft lighting without distracting from the outside world.\n\nIn 2004, the Reformed and Protestant churches merged to form the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. The neighboring Catholic Emmaus Church closed in 1984, after which they were able to use the Johanneskerk monthly, bringing objects such as the tabernacle, a crucifix and a baptismal font, which are still found in the church.",

The pulpit dates from the 17th century, and the silver baptismal font is intricately engraved and dates back to 1857. The hexagonal church tower was blown up by the German occupying forces on February 3, 1945, near the end of World War II. The tower was reconstructed in 1975 and reopened on March 9, 1976.\n",

The current chapel replaced an earlier chapel whose tradition dates back to the 15th century. The chapel is known throughout the Netherlands and beyond as a place where people come to pray to Our Lady in 't Zand. The procession corridor on the south side of the chapel is a later addition.\n",

  "description": "The Kapel van Hoogelande is located in the hamlet of Hoogelande. In 1189, a chapel dedicated to Saint Martin was founded in Hoogelande. In the 15th century, the chapel was expanded into a small church, but it was largely destroyed during the Siege of Middelburg (1572-1574), with only a few wall remains of the choir remaining. In 1912, the chapel and its surroundings were purchased for hunting purposes.\n\nThe current building is built of brick in Gothic style. It has a three-sided closed choir, and the facade is decorated with a small bell gable, which does not contain any bells. The choir was restored in 1965, and planting was established around the chapel. Today, the building is used as a chapel, wedding and baptism location, and for cultural events. There is a cemetery for the residents of Hoogelande near the church.\n",

The church's choir and tower date back to the late Middle Ages. The nave was raised and enlarged with a side aisle in 1540. Inside the church, a large painting of the giant Christopher carrying Jesus on his back, dating from the late fifteenth century, can be found in the choir. The medieval village church has 16th-century murals and a medieval baptismal font. The church was likely built in the 13th century and dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damianus, and rebuilt around 1400 and 1540 into its current form.\n",

The church was largely destroyed by war between 1572 and 1574.\n\nIt was an own church of the Bishop of Utrecht, who therefore also had the tithe rights. The West-Souburg parish church was built in the first half of the 11th century and is first mentioned in written sources in the year 1167. The church of West-Souburg was one of the five mother churches on Walcheren. Daughter churches were the churches of Oud- and Nieuw-Vlissingen, Ritthem, Oost-Souburg and Nieuwerve.\n",

The renovation retained three outer walls and the roof, with the rest being new construction. The renovation and expansion were designed to be inspiring during services and in meetings with each other. The hall where the services take place has chairs placed towards each other, the stage is lowered and a canvas ceiling provides special lighting. Where the building was previously closed and inward-looking, the renovation has broken open the building both inward and outward, creating more transparency and openness with contemporary materials and techniques.

He stipulated that a chapel be built on the property with a painting depicting the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nToday, the church, a listed national monument included in the Guinness Book of Records, functions as a free exhibition space. It can accommodate 12 to 15 people and is open on Sunday afternoons, and also on Wednesdays during the summer.

Initially a church, it exemplifies a mix of architectural styles, primarily rationalism, with Jugendstil details and Expressionist influences in the windows.\n\nThe church features a hexagonal central space under a ten-sided dome, complemented by three arms with rose windows, arranged in an arrow shape. Following its closure as a church in 2011, it was sold and transformed into a theater in 2015, now known as the Koepeltheater, hosting conferences and cultural events.\n",

  "description": "The Koepelkerk in Amsterdam, originally built between 1668 and 1671 by Adriaan Dortsman, served as a Lutheran church. Its unique dome design was a result of religious restrictions on building towers. In 1822, the church was nearly destroyed by fire, but it was rebuilt with a raised dome. The famous Johann Bätz organ was installed in 1830, which remains one of the largest organs in the Netherlands.\n\nUntil 1935, it functioned as a house of worship before becoming a concert hall and event venue. Following a thorough renovation in 1975, the church was transformed into a unique conference and event location. Today, the Koepelkerk is part of the Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel and hosts various events, including weddings, congresses, and fashion shows.\n",
